# 🎨 Art Style Transfer using CNN (VGG19)

This project is a web-based application that performs **Neural Art Style Transfer** by transforming a user-provided content image into the artistic style of another image using deep learning.

The application is built using **Streamlit** and leverages a **pre-trained VGG19 Convolutional Neural Network** to extract content and style features and generate a stylized output image through optimization.

## 🚀 Features
- Upload any content image
- Upload any style image
- Generate a stylized image using CNN
- Interactive web interface built with Streamlit
- Supports any user-provided images

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. The user uploads a content image and a style image.
2. Both images are preprocessed and passed through a pre-trained VGG19 network.
3. Content and style features are extracted from different convolutional layers.
4. A new image is generated by minimizing content and style loss.
5. The final stylized image is displayed in the web application.
